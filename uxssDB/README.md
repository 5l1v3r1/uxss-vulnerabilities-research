# UXSS recorded vulnerabilities

This folder contains some of the UXSS patterns (see ./patterns) that have been used against Browsers in the past. We record some of them in this repository to try to extract valuable information from the study of these previous attacks. Hopefully, we might be able to draft our own attack based on this record.

Then, the malicious URL which contains some JS code, is going to lead to the execution of the malicious JS in the context of whichever domain is currently loaded in the active tab.
- CVE-2016-5181: http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-5181/ -- Vulnerability in WebKit/Blink
- CVE-2016-5165: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=618037 -- Devtools old remote frontend allows running privileged scripts via overwriting localStorage settings -- Attacker can run arbitrary javascript code via watchExpression that runs in the context of the website when DevTools is launched.

- CVE-2014-1747: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=330663 -- UXSS from a local MHTML file
- CVE-2014-1701: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=342618 -- UXSS via dispatchEvent on iframes -- The problem here is that the attacker was able to call "dispatchEvent" on iframe.contentWindow. (Note: DispatchEvent enables to "trigger" an event). In this case, some conditions had to be met for the attack to be successful (such has event handlers returning DOM nodes and so on). In such conditions, an attacker was able to trigger some events and recover the DOM nodes especially the "document" node, which enables to access any part of the embedded page.
- CVE-2013-2849: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=171392 -- Cross-Origin copy&paste / drag&drop allowing XSS -- D&D/C&P black-list doesn't cover srcdoc.

- CVE-2013-0909: document.referrer leakage with XSS Auditor page block -- see: http://homakov.blogspot.kr/2013/02/hacking-with-xss-auditor.html


Actually many reported vulnerabilities used the about:blank URL that inherits the parent's origin to carry out attacks. This endpoint is pretty used to carry out attacks to bypass the SOP (see how many of the CVE we studied used this endpoint in their PoC), also lots of attacks based on extensions exploit/vulerabilities, some attacks use interesting tricks to execute javascript in another origin (such as \u0000 in front of javascipt in a URL, or even white spaces in host IP that lead to a bypass of SOP).
--> Things we mentionned, in some cases, it was ambiguous to know who to the vulnerability belonged to (i.e: Who is responsible for this vulnerability, and who should invest time in trying to solve it -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1199430 for instance)
--> Some interesting attacks are based on the inheritance of some properties from one domain to another.

### Edge/IE

- https://blog.innerht.ml/ie-uxss/ -- Freeze the browser using alert box or synchronous AJAX call (use XMLHTTPRequest.open() with false as 3rd parameter: synchronous call). The goal here is to achieve thread blocking. Before redirecting to target resource, script execution does not break SOP because redirect.php is still on the same origin of the attacker's. However, once the target resource finished loading on frame 1, Internet Explorer will update the origin information accordingly. As a result, the previous script execution will suddenly be executed on the targets' origin. As a side note, the attack has to be done using two frames because Internet Explorer will remove all the object references once navigation occurs. The suggested fix would be either terminate the script execution or remain the origin information when navigation occurs.

- CVE-2014-1530: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=895557 -- It's possible to set a document's URI to a different document's URI by confusing docshell
- CVE-2014-1504: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911547 -- data-URI + Firefox restart = CSP bypass -- This attack scenario uses the fact that some part of the context is saved by the Browser when the Browser is restarted. Such context save might be used to bypass CSP
- CVE-2013-5612: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=871161 -- Potential XSS with cross-domain (cross-origin) inheritance of charset
- CVE-2013-1714 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879787 -- Cross Domain Policy override using webworkers -- Web Workers makes it possible to run a script operation in background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application. The advantage of this is that laborious processing can be performed in a separate thread, allowing the main (usually the UI) thread to run without being blocked/slowed down.
- CVE-2013-1713: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=887098 -- InstallTrigger can use the wrong principal when validating URI loads -- Components/Extensions implementing their own security checks can potentially allow unsafe actions to be performed from content.
- CVE-2013-1709: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=848253 -- 
It's possible to set a document's URI to a different document's URI -- An attacker can create a fake login page whose URI is a real login page's URI. And, if a password for the real login page was already saved in the Password Manager, an attacker can steal the password without user interaction. -- An attacker can inject scripts into a page that uses external scripts with relative URLs.
- CVE-2013-1670: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853709 -- Its possible to call a content level constructor as if from a chrome/privileged page
- CVE-2013-0793: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=803870 -- XSS using timed document navigations -- hash navigation appears to confuse the browser to adopt the same BFCache and/or share a history entry between the 2 adjacent, cross-origin pages
- CVE-2012-5841 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=805807 -- Filtering wrapper should filter setters when returning a property descriptor
- CVE-2012-5837: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800363 -- XSS in Web Developer Toolbar's chrome privilege page -- JS payloads entered in the developer toolbar (specialy crafted payloads) are ran in the context of chrome:// URI. This means JavaScript is run as chrome privilege. The attack shows that one could trigger the run of an executable on windows using this technique.
- CVE-2012-4209 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=792405 -- Frames can shadow |top| -- It is possible to shadow |top| with a frame whose name attribute's value is set to "top". As a result, plugins accessing top.location, such as Adobe Flash Player, may read an arbitrary URL.
- CVE-2012-4194: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=800666 -- Location can be spoofed using |valueOf| -- When an object is joined with a string, its |valueOf| method is called before |toString|, and content can redefine the former.
- CVE-2012-3994 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765527 -- Object.defineProperty can shadow |top| -- Adobe Flash Player opens javascript:top.location+"__flashplugin_unique__" to determine the page origin. And it is possible to shadow |top| using Object.defineProperty.
- CVE-2012-3992 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775009 -- History state error with late navigation involving a hash change -- The trick here is to call history.forward and history.back in a rapid succession such that the targeted website loads into the session of the attacker. This allows the attacker to inject a script loaded from relative path and lead to XSS vulnerability. -- This seemed to be a problem dealing with channel that were not stopped.
- CVE-2012-3985 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655649 -- Script access checks should use effective script origin, not origin -- The HTML5 spec requires that browsers raise a SECURITY_ERR exception when members of the Window object (e.g. localStorage) are accessed by scripts that have a different effective script origin. Firefox allows access by scripts that have the same origin OR the same effective script origin. -- Factor of the vulnerability: Divergence from standard (laziness ?)
- CVE-2012-1966 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=734076 -- XSS with context menu -- perform an XSS attack using data: url
- CVE-2012-1965 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=758990 -- Don't allow feed: URLs with an innerURI that inherits the page's security context -- "feed:javascript:" URLs can be used to XSS sites that just blacklist "javascript:" and "data:" (feed: is used for RSS feed)
- CVE-2012-1956: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756719 -- 
Object.defineProperty can shadow window.location -- Once again, the attacker is able to shadow the "location" object.

- CVE-2012-0474 -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737307 -- universal XSS by confusing docshell with short-circuited loads -- Using history.back/forward/back successively a foreign website can be loaded in another URL + javascript on that page then sends requests to the domain it was loaded into.
- CVE-2012-0455: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704354 -- "DragAndDropJacking" (?) + javAscript: URL = XSS -- Used the Drag and Drop HTML5 feature coupled with some exploit of the case sensitivity of "javascript" URL, to execute malicious code on behalf of a victim's page origin.
- CVE-2012-0446: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=705651 -- Frame scripts that access untrusted objects are exploitable

### Apple Safari

- 

### Opera

- CVE-2013-4705: https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-4705/ -- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Opera before 15.00 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by leveraging UTF-8 encoding.
- CVE-2012-6464: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/1032 -- Cross domain access to object constructors can be used to facilitate cross-site scripting -- JavaScripts are able to redefine and override the methods of native objects. They may also do this with the native objects of any document that shares the same origin. By redefining the methods of another document through the constructor property of the document's host objects, a malicious script can cause Opera to override methods of native objects in documents from different origins. When scripts in those target documents then access those methods, they run the scripts defined by the malicious document, in the context of the target site. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- CVE-2012-6463: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/1031 -- Data URIs can be used to facilitate Cross-Site Scripting -- Data URIs are only supposed to inherit the scripting origin from the site that creates them, such as by including them as the target of a link or an inline frame in the source of the document. Specific sequences of document and data URI loading can cause Opera to forget which document created the data URI, and to allow the data URI document to inherit the scripting origin of a target page instead. The data URI document would then be allowed to interact with the target page, instead of the document that created it, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS).
- CVE-2012-4144: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/1025 -- Element HTML content can be incorrectly returned without escaping, bypassing some HTML sanitizers -- When sites accept HTML from untrusted users, and use that HTML as page content, they typically sanitize the untrusted HTML to ensure that it does not contain any harmful content, such as malicious scripts. In some cases, this sanitization may be performed by writing and reading the contents of DOM elements. In certain situations, Opera may return the HTML contents of an element without correctly escaping all of the characters that denote HTML markup, allowing them to fool the sanitizer, so that they are subsequently interpreted as markup after being inserted into the page. This can then be used to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Opera, without being detected by a sanitizer.
- CVE-2012-4142: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/1026 -- Certain characters in HTML can incorrectly be ignored, which can facilitate XSS attacks -- Sites that allow content to be provided by untrusted users, such as forums and blogging sites, typically sanitize the untrusted content to ensure that it does not contain any harmful content, such as malicious scripts. When certain characters appear at specific locations within HTML markup, they can cause Opera to ignore either that character, or the one following it, potentially altering the interpretation of the following markup. This can be used to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Opera, without being detected by a sanitizer.
- CVE-2012-3556: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/1020 -- A combination of clicks and key presses can lead to cross site scripting or code execution -- Some sort of clickjacking: When a user double clicks on a page, they may expect the two clicks to target the same object. If a page uses the first click to open a pop-up window in a predictable location, the second click may focus parts of the new window, such as its address field. If the page can then convince the user to activate a scripted URL seeded in the address field, on a newly loaded target page within the pop-up, it can allow cross site scripting against the target page. Similar attacks could also be used against Opera's preferences to change preferences or select executables to be run by Opera. Non-trivial social engineering would be required to ensure that the user followed the desired sequence of clicks and keypresses, at precisely the right speed, while ignoring the opening and loading of pages within the pop-up.
- CVE-2012-3555: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/1021 -- Hidden keyboard navigation can allow cross site scripting or code execution -- Some sort of clickjacking: When a user is interacting with a window, that window should be visible to the user, to ensure that the user realizes it is there. If a page is displayed in a small enough window, the user may not realize it is being displayed, and if the right keyboard sequence is carefully followed, they can end up performing undesirable actions on that page. Similar attacks could also be used against Opera's preferences to change preferences or select executables to be run by Opera. Additional social engineering steps are needed to ensure that the user presses the correct key sequence, without being able to show any relevant visual feedback, as the page cannot see that the keys are being pressed.
- CVE-2011-2609: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/995 -- Data URIs may be used to initiate cross site scripting against unrelated sites -- Data URIs are supposed to inherit the security context from the page that created them. In some cases, Opera does not enforce this correctly, and will allow unrelated data URIs to interact both with each other, and their source pages. This can be used to enable cross site scripting against the target site, if the target site has some appropriate markup that allows it to be targeted.
- CVE-2010-4047: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/976 -- JavaScript might run in the wrong context if loaded from error page -- If Opera is sent to an invalid URL, an error page will be displayed along with a link to the URL. The URL linked to might run scripts, and in some cases these scripts might be run in the wrong security context. This can be used to execute scripts in the context of an unrelated domain, which allows cross-site scripting. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must get the user to interact with a specially crafted error page.
- CVE-2010-4045: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/973 -- Reloads and redirects can allow spoofing and cross site scripting -- Scripts on a page are supposed to be restricted so that they can only interact with other pages from the same domain and security context. Carefully timed reloads and redirects, when combined with appropriate caching, can cause scripts to execute in the wrong security context in Opera. This allows cross site scripting (XSS). In some cases, the address bar will also show the address of the target page. With minimal user interaction, this particular XSS vector may also be used to modify Opera's configuration, and this may in turn be used to execute arbitrary code on the computer.
- CVE-2010-2665: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/955 -- Data URIs can be used to allow cross-site scripting -- Data URIs are allowed to run scripts that manipulate pages from the site that directly opened them. In some cases, the opening site is not correctly detected. In these cases, Data URIs may erroneously be able to run scripts so that they interact with sites that did not directly cause them to be opened.
- CVE-2009-4071: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/941 -- Error messages can leak onto unrelated sites -- Scripting error messages are normally available only to the page that caused the error. In some cases, the error messages could be passed to other sites as the contents of unrelated variables, and may contain sensitive information. If those sites write the content into the page markup, this could allow cross-site scripting, using code provided by the attacking site. This issue only affects installations that have enabled stacktraces for exceptions, these are disabled by default.
- CVE-2009-3266: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/939 -- Opera may allow scripts to access feeds -- Opera may allow scripts to run on the feed subscription page, thereby gaining access to the feeds object. This can be used for automatic subscription of feeds, or reading other feeds.
- CVE-2009-3013: http://websecurity.com.ua/3386/ -- Cross-Site Scripting attacks via redirectors -- XSS attack via refresh-header redirectors. Attack is doing by redirecting to javascript: URI.
- CVE-2008-5682: http://www.opera.com/fr/security/advisory/924 -- Built-in XSLT templates can allow cross-site scripting -- Built-in XSLT templates incorrectly handle escaped content and can cause it to be treated as markup. If a site accepts content from untrusted users, which it then displays using XSLT as escaped strings, this can allow scripted markup to be injected. The scripts will then be executed in the security context of that site.

NOTE: XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML.

- CVE-2008-1082 -- https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-1082/ -- "bypass sanitization filters" and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via crafted attribute values in an XML document, which are not properly handled during DOM presentation.

### Conclusion

- We leanrt many things about web dev in this project: marquee html tag, X-XSS-PROTECTION, Many security mechanism, many attack scenarios, we also saw most of (not to say all) notions that have been presented this semester in this course (clickjacking, XSS, CSRF, UI timing attacks, browser extensions and so on) while we studied the previous attacks in the CVE record, 

What we conclude from this study: UXSS will always occur/new vulns will always be found... --> Many =/= platforms, iOS, Android, Laptop (=/= OS) and so on + Browsers are extremely complicated software. The area for attackers to exploit potential vulnerabilities is really big (many things that can be exploited by attackers --> extensions, =/= internal components of the browser, third party component (cf: Blink/Webkit for instance), and so on...). The diversity of attacks is really really big. We though it would be easy to come up with patterns used to bypass the SoP, but it was not as simple as that. Some patterns can be detected, but this is not as obvious as we first thought.
We learnt a lot, we are not a team specilized/familiar with web development, but througout this study we were able to learn many things about UXSS attacks and about web development in general.
Moreover, while browsers provide users with a way to access resources plublished on the Web, they also ambed a very large number of features that make our web surfing way more agreable. In addition, they implement all sort of security mechanisms to prevent our personal/sensitive data from being accessed leaked out. Nevertheless, some of these mechanisms can be bypassed by attackers. Thus, these malicious users can tehn gain access to victim's sensitive data. That is the reason why web application developpers should not rely on browsers to secure their customer's data. Security on the web has to be handled and taken into consideration by everyone. Web app devs should define strict CSPs, use HTTPONLY cookies to prevent some javascript code from accessing them, do frame busting using the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header, use session IDs for a small amount of time, be careful with quick change of IP address when a user uses a webservice (at login and so on), use strong keys and encryption scheme for encrypted communications (see the paper "How DH fails in practice"), and keep on following the news in the web security areas while keeping their security infrastructure up to date.

-- We saw that a simple small error/lack of check of in a feature in a browser could lead to dramatic vulnerabilities that would threaten all users. A simple Drag and Drop and some malicious code could be added in an embedded/victim page and thus, some malicious code could be executed on his behalf.


To go further: Browsers developers might need to handle discrepancies in network traffic (see paper of SCA based on packet size), since personal data can also be leaked out further to network analysis of a passive attacker. So, despite all encrytpion and security mechanisms that are being implemented by browser developers, they might need to go a step further and hide our network trace to keep our data completelly safe. + (See paper about DH "How DH fails in practice" --> browser developers need to do a perpetual surveillance of what's going on in the security area and stop supporting deprecated Encryption schemeand so on.)

[TODO]
Say how many UXSS attacks we studied, and try to classify all these attacks into groups in order to get some insightful statistics and try to get the most used vulnerabilities to carry out UXSS attacks.
