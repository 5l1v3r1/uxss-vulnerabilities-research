## Intro
Unlike the common XSS attacks, UXSS is a type of attack that exploits client-side vulnerabilities in the browser or browser extensions in order to generate an XSS condition, and execute malicious code. When such vulnerabilities are found and exploited, the behavior of the browser is affected and its security features may be bypassed or disabled.
Moreover, it is not just the browser itself which may have an exploitable flaw, but also any of its many extensions. 
The fact that the nature of the attack does not require a vulnerable web page to be exploited, while simultaneously retaining the possibility of gaining access to non-vulnerable web pages, makes UXSS one of the most dangerous and damaging types of attacks from the XSS spectrum. This is further enforced by the fact that UXSS also targets vulnerable browser add-ons or plugins and not just the browser itself.
